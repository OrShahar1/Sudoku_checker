# Sudoku_checker

The Sudoku game is set using a 9 x 9 board (i.e. 9 rows and 9 columns).

In a valid game solution:

1. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears once per one.

2. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears once in each column 

3. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears once in each bold square (see drawing below).

In this program we will write code to check solution for the Sudoku game (i.e. a suitable 2D array).

And checks whether it is a valid solution.
